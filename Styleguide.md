| TRUE   | [ComplexCondition](https://detekt.dev/docs/rules/complexity#complexcondition)                       | Complex conditions make it hard to understand which cases lead to the condition being true or false. To improve readability and understanding of complex conditions consider extracting them into well-named functions or variables and call those instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| TRUE   | [ComplexInterface](https://detekt.dev/docs/rules/complexity#complexinterface)                       | Complex interfaces which contain too many functions and/or properties indicate that this interface is handling too many things at once. Interfaces should follow the single-responsibility principle to also encourage implementations of this interface to not handle too many things at once. <br><br> Large interfaces should be split into smaller interfaces which have a clear responsibility and are easier to understand and implement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| TRUE   | [ComplexMethod](https://detekt.dev/docs/rules/complexity#complexmethod)                             | Complex methods are hard to understand and read. It might not be obvious what side-effects a complex method has. Prefer splitting up complex methods into smaller methods that are in turn easier to understand. Smaller methods can also be named much clearer which leads to improved readability of the code. <br><br> This rule uses McCabe's Cyclomatic Complexity (MCC) metric to measure the number of linearly independent paths through a function's source code ([NDepend Code Metrics Definitions](https://www.ndepend.com/docs/code-metrics#CC)). The higher the number of independent paths, the more complex a method is. Complex methods use too many of the following statements. Each one of them adds one to the complexity count. |
| FALSE  | [LabeledExpression](https://detekt.dev/docs/rules/complexity#labeledexpression)                     | This rule reports labeled expressions. Expressions with labels generally increase complexity and worsen the maintainability of the code. Refactor the violating code to not use labels instead. Labeled expressions referencing an outer class with a label from an inner class are allowed, because there is no way to get the instance of an outer class from an inner class in Kotlin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| TRUE   | [LargeClass](https://detekt.dev/docs/rules/complexity#largeclass)                                   | This rule reports large classes. Classes should generally have one responsibility. Large classes can indicate that the class does instead handle multiple responsibilities. Instead of doing many things at once prefer to split up large classes into smaller classes. These smaller classes are then easier to understand and handle less things.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| TRUE   | [LongMethod](https://detekt.dev/docs/rules/complexity#longmethod)                                   | Methods should have one responsibility. Long methods can indicate that a method handles too many cases at once. Prefer smaller methods with clear names that describe their functionality clearly. <br><br> Extract parts of the functionality of long methods into separate, smaller methods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| TRUE   | [LongParameterList](https://detekt.dev/docs/rules/complexity#longparameterlist)                     | Reports functions and constructors which have more parameters than a certain threshold.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| FASLE  | [MethodOverloading](https://detekt.dev/docs/rules/complexity#methodoverloading)                     | This rule reports methods which are overloaded often. Method overloading tightly couples these methods together which might make the code harder to understand.  <br> <br>  Refactor these methods and try to use optional parameters instead to prevent some of the overloading.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| FALSE  | [NamedArguments](https://detekt.dev/docs/rules/complexity#namedarguments)                           | Reports function invocations which have more arguments than a certain threshold and are all not named. Calls with too many arguments are more difficult to understand so a named arguments help.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| TRUE   | [NestedBlockDepth](https://detekt.dev/docs/rules/complexity#nestedblockdepth)                       | This rule reports excessive nesting depth in functions. Excessively nested code becomes harder to read and increases its hidden complexity. It might become harder to understand edge-cases of the function.  <br> <br> Prefer extracting the nested code into well-named functions to make it easier to understand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| FALSE  | [NestedScopeFunctions](https://detekt.dev/docs/rules/complexity#nestedscopefunctions)               | Although the scope functions are a way of making the code more concise, avoid overusing them: it can decrease your code readability and lead to errors. Avoid nesting scope functions and be careful when chaining them: it's easy to get confused about the current context object and the value of this or it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| FALSE  | [ReplaceSafeCallChainWithRun](https://detekt.dev/docs/rules/complexity#replacesafecallchainwithrun) | Chains of safe calls on non-nullable types are redundant and can be removed by enclosing the redundant safe calls in a `run {}` block. This improves code coverage and reduces cyclomatic complexity as redundant null checks are removed. <br> <br> This rule only checks from the end of a chain and works backwards, so it won't recommend inserting run blocks in the middle of a safe call chain as that is likely to make the code more difficult to understand. <br> <br> The rule will check for every opportunity to replace a safe call when it sits at the end of a chain, even if there's only one, as that will still improve code coverage and reduce cyclomatic complexity.                                                           |
| FALSE  | [StringLiteralDuplication](https://detekt.dev/docs/rules/complexity#stringliteralduplication)       | This rule detects and reports duplicated String literals. Repeatedly typing out the same String literal across the codebase makes it harder to change and maintain. <br> <br> Instead, prefer extracting the String literal into a property or constant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| TRUE   | [TooManyFunctions](https://detekt.dev/docs/rules/complexity#toomanyfunctions)                       | This rule reports files, classes, interfaces, objects and enums which contain too many functions. Each element can be configured with different thresholds.  <br> <br> Too many functions indicate a violation of the single responsibility principle. Prefer extracting functionality which clearly belongs together in separate parts of the code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| TRUE   | [GlobalCoroutineUsage](https://detekt.dev/docs/rules/coroutines#globalcoroutineusage)                                 | Report usages of `GlobalScope.launch` and `GlobalScope.async`. It is highly discouraged by the Kotlin documentation: <br> <br>- Global scope is used to launch top-level coroutines which are operating on the whole application lifetime and are > not cancelled prematurely. <br> <br>- Application code usually should use an application-defined CoroutineScope. Using async or launch on the instance > of GlobalScope is highly discouraged. <br> <br> See [GlobalScope](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/-global-scope/) | 
| TRUE   | [InjectDispatcher](https://detekt.dev/docs/rules/coroutines#injectdispatcher)                                         | Always use dependency injection to inject dispatchers for easier testing. This rule is based on the recommendation [Best practices for coroutines in Android - Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines/coroutines-best-practices#inject-dispatchers)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| TRUE   | [RedundantSuspendModifier](https://detekt.dev/docs/rules/coroutines#redundantsuspendmodifier)                         | `suspend` modifier should only be used where needed, otherwise the function can only be used from other suspending functions. This needlessly restricts use of the function and should be avoided by removing the `suspend` modifier where it's not needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| TRUE   | [SleepInsteadOfDelay](https://detekt.dev/docs/rules/coroutines#sleepinsteadofdelay)                                   | Report usages of `Thread.sleep` in suspending functions and coroutine blocks. A thread can contain multiple coroutines at one time due to coroutines' lightweight nature, so if one coroutine invokes `Thread.sleep`, it could potentially halt the execution of unrelated coroutines and cause unpredictable behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| FALSE  | [SuspendFunWithCoroutineScopeReceiver](https://detekt.dev/docs/rules/coroutines#suspendfunwithcoroutinescopereceiver) | Suspend functions that use `CoroutineScope` as receiver should not be marked as suspend. A `CoroutineScope` provides structured concurrency via its `coroutineContext`. A `suspend` function also has its own `coroutineContext`, which is now ambiguous and mixed with the receiver`s. <br><br> See https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-basics.html#scope-builder-and-concurrency                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| TRUE   | [SuspendFunWithFlowReturnType](https://detekt.dev/docs/rules/coroutines#suspendfunwithflowreturntype)                 | Functions that return `Flow` from `kotlinx.coroutines.flow` should not be marked as `suspend`. `Flows` are intended to be cold observable streams. The act of simply invoking a function that returns a `Flow`, should not have any side effects. Only once collection begins against the returned `Flow`, should work actually be done. <br><br> See https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html#flows-are-cold                                                                                                                                                                            |

Empty catch blocks indicate that an exception is ignored and not handled. In case exceptions are ignored intentionally, this should be made explicit by using the specified names in the `allowedExceptionNameRegex`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## Exceptions Rule Set
Rules in this rule set report issues related to how code throws and handles Exceptions.

| TRUE   | [ExceptionRaisedInUnexpectedLocation](https://detekt.dev/docs/rules/exceptions#exceptionraisedinunexpectedlocation)         | This rule reports functions which should never throw an exception. If a function exists that does throw an exception it will be reported. By default, this rule checks `toString`, `hashCode`, `equals` and `finalize`. This rule is configurable via the `methodNames` configuration to change the list of functions which should not throw any exceptions.                                                                                                                                                 |
| TRUE   | [InstanceOfCheckForException](https://detekt.dev/docs/rules/exceptions#instanceofcheckforexception)                         | This rule reports `catch` blocks which check for the type of exception via `is` checks or casts. Instead of catching generic exception types and then checking for specific exception types the code should use multiple catch blocks. These catch blocks should then catch the specific exceptions.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| FALSE  | [NotImplementedDeclaration](https://detekt.dev/docs/rules/exceptions#notimplementeddeclaration)                             | This rule reports all exceptions of the type `NotImplementedError` that are thrown. It also reports all `TODO(..)` functions. These indicate that functionality is still under development and will not work properly. Both of these should only serve as temporary declarations and should not be put into production environments.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| FALSE  | [ObjectExtendsThrowable](https://detekt.dev/docs/rules/exceptions#objectextendsthrowable)                                   | This rule reports all `objects` including `companion objects` that extend any type of `Throwable`. Throwable instances are not intended for reuse as they are stateful and contain mutable information about a specific exception or error. Hence, global singleton `Throwables` should be avoided. <br> <br> See https://kotlinlang.org/docs/object-declarations.html#object-declarations-overview  <br> <br> See https://kotlinlang.org/docs/object-declarations.html#companion-objects                    |
| TRUE   | [PrintStackTrace](https://detekt.dev/docs/rules/exceptions#printstacktrace)                                                 | This rule reports code that tries to print the stacktrace of an exception. Instead of simply printing a stacktrace a better logging solution should be used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| TRUE   | [RethrowCaughtException](https://detekt.dev/docs/rules/exceptions#rethrowcaughtexception)                                   | This rule reports all exceptions that are caught and then later re-thrown without modification. It ignores cases: <br> <br> When caught exceptions that are rethrown if there is work done before that. <br> <br> When there are more than one catch in try block and at least one of them has some work.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| TRUE   | [ReturnFromFinally](https://detekt.dev/docs/rules/exceptions#returnfromfinally)                                             | Reports all `return` statements in `finally` blocks. Using `return` statements in `finally` blocks can discard and hide exceptions that are thrown in the `try` block. Furthermore, this rule reports values from `finally` blocks, if the corresponding `try` is used as an expression.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

This rule reports all instances where exceptions are caught and not correctly passed (e.g. as a cause) into a newly thrown exception. <br> <br> The exception types configured in ignoredExceptionTypes indicate nonexceptional outcomes. These by default configured exception types are part of Java. Therefore, Kotlin developers have to handle them by using the catch clause. For that reason, this rule ignores that these configured exception types are caught. |
| TRUE   | [ThrowingExceptionFromFinally](https://detekt.dev/docs/rules/exceptions#throwingexceptionfromfinally)                       | This rule reports all cases where exceptions are thrown from a `finally` block. Throwing exceptions from a `finally` block should be avoided as it can lead to confusion and discarded exceptions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| FALSE  | [ThrowingExceptionInMain](https://detekt.dev/docs/rules/exceptions#throwingexceptioninmain)                                 | This rule reports all exceptions that are thrown in a `main` method. An exception should only be thrown if it can be handled by a "higher" function.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| TRUE   | [ThrowingExceptionsWithoutMessageOrCause](https://detekt.dev/docs/rules/exceptions#throwingexceptionswithoutmessageorcause) | This rule reports all exceptions which are thrown without arguments or further description. Exceptions should always call one of the constructor overloads to provide a message or a cause. Exceptions should be meaningful and contain as much detail about the error case as possible. This will help to track down an underlying issue in a better way.                                                                                                                                                   |
| TRUE   | [ThrowingNewInstanceOfSameException](https://detekt.dev/docs/rules/exceptions#throwingnewinstanceofsameexception)           | Exceptions should not be wrapped inside the same exception type and then rethrown. Prefer wrapping exceptions in more meaningful exception types.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| TRUE   | [TooGenericExceptionCaught](https://detekt.dev/docs/rules/exceptions#toogenericexceptioncaught)                             | This rule reports `catch` blocks for exceptions that have a type that is too generic. It should be preferred to catch specific exceptions to the case that is currently handled. If the scope of the caught exception is too broad it can lead to unintended exceptions being caught.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| TRUE   | [TooGenericExceptionThrown](https://detekt.dev/docs/rules/exceptions#toogenericexceptionthrown)                             | This rule reports thrown exceptions that have a type that is too generic. It should be preferred to throw specific exceptions to the case that has currently occurred.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Benchmarks showing this performance penalty can be seen here: [Kotlin's hidden costs - Benchmarks - Renato Athaydes](https://sites.google.com/a/athaydes.com/renato-athaydes/posts/kotlinshiddencosts-benchmarks) <br><br> The Kotlin compiler since v1.1.60 has an optimization that skips the array copy when an array constructor function is used to create the arguments that are passed to the vararg parameter.

| FALSE  | [AbsentOrWrongFileLicense](https://detekt.dev/docs/rules/comments#absentorwrongfilelicense)               | This rule will report every Kotlin source file which doesn't have the required license header. The rule validates each Kotlin source and operates in two modes: if `licenseTemplateIsRegex = false` (or missing) the rule checks whether the input file header starts with the read text from the passed file in the `licenseTemplateFile` configuration option. If `licenseTemplateIsRegex = true` the rule matches the header with a regular expression produced from the passed template license file (defined via `licenseTemplateFile` configuration option).                                                                                                                  |
| FALSE  | [CommentOverPrivateFunction](https://detekt.dev/docs/rules/comments#commentoverprivatefunction)           | This rule reports comments and documentation that has been added to private functions. These comments get reported because they probably explain the functionality of the private function. However, private functions should be small enough and have an understandable name so that they are self-explanatory and do not need this comment in the first place. <br><br> Instead of simply removing this comment to solve this issue prefer to split up the function into smaller functions with better names if necessary. Giving the function a better, more descriptive name can also help in solving this issue.                                                               |
| FALSE  | [CommentOverPrivateProperty](https://detekt.dev/docs/rules/comments#commentoverprivateproperty)           | This rule reports comments and documentation above private properties. This can indicate that the property has a confusing name or is not in a small enough context to be understood. Private properties should be named in a self-explanatory way and readers of the code should be able to understand why the property exists and what purpose it solves without the comment. <br><br> Instead of simply removing the comment to solve this issue, prefer renaming the property to a more self-explanatory name. If this property is inside a bigger class, it makes sense to refactor and split up the class. This can increase readability and make the documentation obsolete. |

Deprecation must be specified using a `@Deprecated` annotation as adding a `@deprecated` block tag in KDoc comments [has no effect and is not supported](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/kotlin-doc.html#suppress). The `@Deprecated` annotation constructor has dedicated fields for a message and a type (warning, error, etc.).
